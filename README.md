Mankind has always been known by advancements in materials; for example from stone age to the silicon age! This 
significance is too well known if one observes the chips driving the current AI revolution: GPU. Not all materials are 
made from the traditional metals and alloys nor using the traditional manufacturing techniques. The need of the coming 
times is engineering (new) materials as required (in contrast to engineering of existing materials) based on need. For 
example, a bio-degradable material for holding water in a bottle, fuel for automobiles (green hydrogen) etc.
**The goal of this project is to fine-tune LLM for discovering / designing advanced, custom new materials.** A MERN-stack 
based UI might be necessary to test the above LLM. 

The steps for realizing this project would include:

1) Identifying the LLM to be fine-tuned with materials data. 
2) Download datasets and pick the relevant subset to be used for fine-tuning. 
3) Fine-tune the LLM.
4) Develop test cases for verifying the LLM.
5) Develop a MERN-stack based UI to implement the above test cases.
